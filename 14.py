# On the stop we have N passengers, which Vanja and Peter were among, called at a trolleybus. The Vanja purchased a ticket
# the first. Peter glanced on the ticket and saw that the number of ticket is a prime number, and decided, that he must
# purchase a ticket with a simple number. Whether there is a chance at Peter to purchase a ticket to a next stop, if at a
# conductor only one roll of tickets, in the numbers of tickets is determined the amount by the bought ticket. In case if
# a roll is closed, Peter will stow "away", and he is expected by a failure.
#
# Input
# An entrance line contains two numbers: amount of passengers and number of trolleybus ticket. The amount of numbers in
# the number of ticket does not exceed 6.
#
# Output
# Show out the amount of passengers, which it is necessary to skip Peter, to purchase a ticket with a simple number, or
# â€“1, if doing it is impossible.
